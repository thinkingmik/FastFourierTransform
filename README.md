Fast Fourier Transform
====================

Compute the Fast Fourier Transform of sampled data.

This class can be used to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of sampled data, as well the inverse Fast Fourier transform.

It takes an array of sample data values and calculates the respective Fast Fourier Transform. The result is returned as an array of complex values.

The class can also do the opposite, i.e. compute the inverse Fast Fourier transform .
